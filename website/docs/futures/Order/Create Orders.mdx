- `Balance`: (walletBalance - openOrderMarginFrozen), api: `/future/user/v1/compat/balance/list`
- `Percent`: user input, e.g. `0.2`
- `Leverage`: leverage you want, e.g. `20`
- `Mark_price`: current symbol mark price, e.g. `88888 (btc_usdt)`
- `Contract_size`: contractSize, api: `/future/market/v1/public/symbol/detail`, contract multiplier (face value)

**Example** truncate(10000 _ 0.2 _ 20 / 88888 / 0.0001) = 4500
