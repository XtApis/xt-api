#### Signature Parameters Description

Since XT provides open APIs to third-party platforms, data security must be ensured — for example, preventing data tampering, avoiding outdated data, blocking duplicate submissions, and controlling request frequency. Among these, **data integrity verification** is the most crucial aspect.

##### Signature Parameters

1. **validate-appkey** — Public key obtained after applying for the API Key
2. **validate-timestamp** — Request timestamp in milliseconds (Unix time). Request validity is determined based on this value and `validate-recvwindow`
3. **validate-signature** — Some API requests require a signature. See details in ([Access Description -> Signature](../Access%20Description/Signature))
4. **validate-recvwindow** — Defines the validity period of a request. Default is 5 seconds; maximum is 60 seconds
   - If the timestamp is more than 5000ms earlier than server time, the request is invalid
   - If the client timestamp is more than 1 second ahead of server time, the request will also be rejected
   - It is **not recommended** to exceed 5 seconds, as this helps handle network jitter and ensures timeliness in high-frequency trading
5. **validate-algorithms** — Signature is generated using an HSC-based algorithm
   - Default: HmacSHA256
   - Supported: HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA224, HmacSHA256, HmacSHA384, HmacSHA512
