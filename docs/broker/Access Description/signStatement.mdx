Since XT needs to provide some open interfaces for third-party platforms, the issue of data security needs to be considered.
Such as whether the data has been tampered with, whether the data is outdated, whether the data can be submitted repeatedly, and the access frequency of the interface.
Whether data has been tampered with is the most important issue.

### Instructions

1. Please apply for **appkey** and **secretkey** in the user center first. Each user's appkey and secretkey are different.

2. Add **timestamp**, its value should be the Unix timestamp (milliseconds) of the time when the request is sent.
   The server validates the data time based on this value.

3. Add **signature**, its value is obtained by a certain rule of signature algorithm.

4. Add **recvwindow** (defining the valid time of the request).

   - When a request is received by the server, the timestamp in the request is checked to ensure it falls between **2 to 60 seconds**.
   - Any request with a timestamp older than **5000 ms** is considered invalid.
   - The time window value can be set using the optional parameter: `recvWindow`.
   - If the server determines that the client's timestamp is more than **1 second ahead**, the request will also be invalid.
   - Online conditions may cause varying latency, so `recvWindow` can be adjusted according to your needs.
   - **Not recommended:** `recvWindow` longer than 5 seconds.

5. Add **algorithm** (signature method/algorithm).
   The user calculates the signature according to the protocol of the hash. **HmacSHA256 is recommended**.

   Supported algorithms:

   - HmacMD5
   - HmacSHA1
   - HmacSHA224
   - HmacSHA256 (recommended)
   - HmacSHA384
   - HmacSHA512
